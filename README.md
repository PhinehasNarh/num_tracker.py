- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `phonenumbers`
  - `opencage`
  - `folium`

Install the libraries using:
```bash
pip install phonenumbers opencage folium
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhinehasNarh/number_tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
